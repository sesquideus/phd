\abstract{ %
    Deployment of multi-station video meteor networks presents a unique opportunity to measure
    the total mass flux of meteoroids impinging on the surface of the Earth. However, direct measurement
    of particle flux is not possible as the data are heavily distorted by selection bias. We present
    a method for debiasing the data using a simulation of meteoroid particles entering the atmosphere
    and its reference implementation.
}{ % aims
    To develop methods of debiasing ground-based meteor observations performed with all-sky cameras
    nd to use the obtained data to determine the total particle and mass influx.
}{ % methods
    A population of meteoroid particles with known chemical composition, population index and orbital elements
    is created above the Earth's atmosphere.
    The trajectory of each virtual meteoroid is tracked and after application of selection bias
    the resulting meteor observation is recorded.
    Once a sufficiently large dataset is obtained, statistical tests
    are performed and the distributions are compared to observational data from the AMOS camera network.
    The entire procedure is repeated and the parameters of the simulation are gradually adjusted until
    best possible agreement with observational data is found.
}{ % results
    To be added later.
}{ % conclusions
    None so far.

    Deployment of multi-station video meteor networks presents a unique opportunity to measure the total mass flux of meteoroids impinging on
    the surface of the Earth. However, direct measurement of particle flux is not possible as the data are
    heavily distorted by selection bias. We present a
    method for debiasing the data using a simulation of
    meteoroid particles entering the atmosphere. The trajectory of each virtual meteoroid is tracked and after application of biases the resulting meteor observation is recorded. Once a sufficiently large dataset is
    obtained, statistical tests are performed and the distributions are compared to observational data from
    AMOS camera network. The entire procedure is repeated and the parameters of the simulation are gradually adjusted until best possible agreement with observational data is found.

-Abstract: option: if possible do mention one application or result following the usage of the tool.
!!!!!!

-l 8: reference and additional explanations are needed: I agree meteor science is notoriously difficult, but please explain why for a non-meteor scientist (after all, black hole science is difficult as well...)
    Accepted, added and explanation.

-l 17: artificial meteor experiments were also performed in the 60s: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1970SAOSR.317.....A/abstract ; please explain which models such experiment would improve (disintegration, ablation?)
    Accepted, added a brief explanation.

-l 19: option: ideally it would be nice to quantify the cost of such experiment. The only today sound rocket I know is the Japanese MOMO (http://www.istellartech.com);
I might be completely off but I recall the price per kg is about 10k$.
    I understand, it sounds about right to me. But the problem is mostly with achieving high velocities typical for showers (> 30 km/s).
    Just launching the material to LEO or a highly eccentric orbit is not so difficult these days.

-l 27: option: why is the density of the atmosphere to be empirically determined? I thought is was well known, even at very high altitude thanks to satellite drag (I might be wrong...)
    It changes with latitude / solar activity / ... Also the models (MSIS and such) are not simple analytic expressions, but tabulated values.

-l 34: "To address this": here is an example of sentence that looks too vague: to address which scientific question exactly? Again in sec 5 we learn that the initial need was to de-bias meteor shower observation,
    so it would be worth mentionning it here (see also very first comment above).
    Well noticed.

-l 46-48: option: I would put this sentence at the end of the article, but it's really up to you
    I tried to, but in the end I decided I like it where it is. Reworded slightly.

-l 48-49 : an outline of the paper would be nice here. Also, an overview of the tool MUST be included: it might be a schema, drawing (whatever...)
but the reader needs the big picture of the tool before the details are presented. Such big picture would mention some I/O, packages or scripts or data or models needed for the tools etc.
Several steps (for several purpose/result?) must also be included. The point is: the reader needs an overview of the tool before you describe the models (theory) and the capabilities.
    Understood, I added an overview schema and a detailed list.
!!! acutally add the list

-l 55 : sum up the tool specifications here ; then explain why it must not be used for super acccurate results such as dark flight calculation
    Did so.

-l 65: a piece of advice for future development: please use the SPICE tool for python (https://spiceypy.readthedocs.io/) :
it will both save you a lot of time, make your code robust and (maybe most important) compatible with any space agency tool.
You'll be able to get the latest Earth radii and many more constants.
    Will have a look at it.

-l 66: "negligeable for most purpose": again this is too vague: please specify.
    Done. We added an option for the WGS84 model in the meantime, but it is not

-l 78: "purpose": as stated earlier, such a purpose is not clear in the paper as it stands today.
    Restated.

-l 82-83: great, but what are the needed I/O for such a replacement? (ok maybe this is beyond the scope of the paper...).
    Just a simple modification of some of the program's classes. This should be mentioned in the documentation.

-eqn 2: please define v, m, rho (in the text right before the eqn ; yes I'm being picky...)
    Done. This is the best kind of pickiness.

-l 104: references are needed in this paragraph
    Done.

-l 109: the physical quantity A does not appear in eqn 5, so it's hard to understand what the authors want to say here
    Rewritten and simplified.

-l 122: another too vague expression: why does it mean to "normalize to the visible spectrum"? If the flux is given in Watt, what is the need to normalize?
    Rewritten and specified. The proper unit here would be something more like the lumen, but normalised for the camera instead of human eyes.
    I understand (Hill et al. 2005) defined \tau so that it only includes visible light (without stating the precise spectral distribution, which also depends on material).
    Ideally we should model the total bolometric flux and the spectrum as well, then simulate the attenuation in the atmosphere
    and finally apply a filter representing the spectral sensitivity of the camera.
    Of course this is would be a much more complex approach -- hence this simplification.

-l 124 : ok for the Solar spectrum (because it's easy to implement and meteor spectra are a nightmare...), but please recall that meteor spectra are nothing like black body spectrum (atomic emission lines...).
    Noted, it is only a very simple approximation. Without further assumptions about composition we do not believe it is possible to devise anything much better.

-l 125: ok but what is the spetral response of human eye in the visible range? Can the tool also consider a camera spectral response?
    Not currently, but with an improved model of emission that could be implemented as well.

-l 143: note: 1976 standard atmosphere is not correct above ~80 km of altitude ; MSIS-E-90 is definitely the model to use
    Yes, unless we can plug in something even better. A direct query of MSIS-E-90 for the specified date/time/position would be even better.

-l 188: option: you might cite Koschak & Rendtel 1990
    Added.

-l 202: please provide range (or ref) for real population
    (Removed from the text).

-l 206: why 1 kg? Please explain
    (Removed from the text after consulting another reviewer). The reason is to cut the heavy tail of the distribution and ensure that mean, variance and other moments are defined.

-l 221: typo: "stay is"
    fixed

-l 231-232: if possible provide an eqn
    Very good idea, done.

-l 235: option: how does the constant velocity reproduce reality?
    Depends on the purpose (and that is the reason why everything is configurable, this is mostly the user's responsibility).
    In determination of fluxes this proved sufficient -- for Perseids values between 58 and 60 km/s did not make any visible difference, it disappeared in other errors.

-l 243: "needed": for what?
    To actually generate the originally requested number of particles. I added it to the beginning of the section.

-l 245: warning: an area cannot be equal to a cosine...
    Yes, it should be the ratio of effective/true. Reformulated (see next).

-l 247: "this value": which one? value of what? the cosine or the area? This is anothe rexample of way too vague sentence...
    Of the cosine of radiant altitude (and thus also mean radiant altitude). Reformulated to make clearer.

-l 255: RK4??? I understand the purpose is speed, but how reliable is a 4th order integrator? Note that you can easily change it to a higher order one, e.g. scipy.integrate.Radau or scipy.integrate.DOP853
    For these purposes it is more than sufficient, we have performed extensive tests with variable time steps.
    Also an adaptive Dormand-Prince integrator was added in the meantime, which either halves and doubles the number of steps between frames depending on the error estimate.
    In simulations of shower meteors the performance loss is negligible, but so is the increase of precision, for instance when compared to a 1000 FPS RK4.
    It is kept as an option in the code, but did not seem important enough to mention in the paper.


-l 255: I suspect the integration is performed w.r.t time, but please specify it
    Added

-l 261: why 10^-12 kg? I guess a 10^-9 kg would already not be detectable by naked eye (but I may be wrong)
    This is just a safety margin. It is not very important though, in the final part of the simulation the mass approaches zero quickly.

-l 312: "detection system seem to prefer": not clear: a detection algorithm works regardless of the location in the image.
Granted the S/N might be better at the center for strong vignetted optics (true for allsky cameras), but not for all systems.
    I made it more clear we are primarily concerned with all-sky cameras.

-sec 3.4.3: remark: the detection algorithm might play a role as well
    It does, but UFOAnalyzer cannot be easily analyzed. once we switch to an in-house algorithm, a better analysis will be done.

-l 336: reference would be nice here
    Added.

-l 357: ideally a histogram of the meteors before and after the selection process would be nice. Indeed depending on the mass/magnitude distribution index,
the number of selected meteors might differ. Note that this results also shows that the process is ~13% efficient. Ideally an estimate of the time it takes to
generate and select those 10000 meteors would be nice, in order to have an idea of the performances of the tool.
!!!

-l 402: promising for what? Observation of modeling?
    Reformulated.

-l 408: note that the largest bodies do not decelerate until very late in the atmosphere
    I understand, I changed the formulation.

-l 409: typo: "such as" -> "such a"
    Fixed.

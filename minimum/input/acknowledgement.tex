\section*{Acknowledgement}
    First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Juraj Tóth, for all the coffees and the hours spent in conversation
    about everything relevant (and often not) to the topic of this thesis.

    I am very grateful to Peter Vereš for suggesting a simulation, as this interesting idea has become the
    cornerstone of the thesis. Developing and testing it was very entertaining and taught me a lot.

    Special thanks belong to Justína Nováková for the provided pictures, and for her moral support
    during these difficult and demanding times.

The final product would thus be a five-dimensional map, or distribution, of meteor activity, with independent variables being
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \emph{temporal coordinate}, representing the variation of meteor activity in time    \item the \emph{mass spectrum}, describing the distribution of meteoroid masses, typically in terms of \textit{mass index} $s$;
    \item and the \emph{velocity spectrum}, describing the velocities of objects passing through this point, which can be in turn described by
        \begin{itemize}
            \item two spatial coordinates, the \emph{right ascension and declination} of the radiant, or $\alpha$ and $\delta$;
            \item and \emph{speed} $v$.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

described by the \emph{meteor activity function}

    \rho(t, \vec{v}, m) \equiv \rho(\lambda_\odot, \delta, \alpha, v, m).

Within this map we are able to distinguish two main features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the \emph{sporadic background}, which forms the main contour lines of the maps, the ``terrain'';
    \item and the well-defined peaks, representing the \emph{meteor showers}. All such peaks are invariably
        very narrow in the speed domain, 
    
\end{itemize}
    Due to influences of various acting forces, such as differences
    in initial velocities with respect to the parent body, tidal disruptions, 
    perturbations arising from close encounters with large bodies of the Solar System,
    Poynting-Robertson effect, etc., the stream
    gradually widens and disperses in all components until it is no longer recognizable from the background.

        In examining the evolution we may recognize two distinct components:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item the \emph{periodic component}, emerging as the result of the Earth orbiting the Sun.
                This coordinate can be thus expressed in terms of the \emph{longitude of the sun} $\lambda_\odot$.

            \item the slowly-varying \emph{secular component}, associated with appearance of new meteoroid streams and gradual decay of older
                streams which are not replenished.

                The peaks produced by meteor showers appear relatively abruptly after the parent body passes through the vicinty of the Earth,
                producing small bodies due to heating or outgassing.
                Even so, returns of parents bodies on periodic orbits, such as comets 1P/Halley or 109P/Swift-Tuttle, do result
                in resupply of meteoroid material, and thus form an extra periodic component, included in the secular evolution of the stream.

            
        which can be expressed as and a secular component, which is the result
        of the evolution of the associated stream;

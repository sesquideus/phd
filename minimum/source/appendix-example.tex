A simple example of the graphical output of the observational model.

    An example of the sky map for one night of observations.
    Individual meteoroid radiants are pictured as dots,
    with larger dots corresponding to more massive particles.
    In the background the underlying distribution of radiants is obtained
    using a spherical KDE method with a Gaussian kernel.

    In the picture are displayed 10000 sporadic meteors with uniform distribution of radiants
    and three fictional meteor showers with different dispersion profiles.

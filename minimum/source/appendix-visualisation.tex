    An example of the sky map for one night of observations.
    Individual meteor radiants are pictured as dots,
    with larger dots representing brighter meteors.
    In the background the underlying distribution of radiants is obtained
    using a spherical KDE method with a Gaussian kernel.

    In the picture are displayed 10000 sporadic meteors with uniform distribution of radiants
    and three fictional meteor showers with different dispersion profiles.

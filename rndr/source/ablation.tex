So far, we were concerned purely with the dynamics of the entry, or the change of position and velocity of the particle.
However, the description is not complete without considering the loss of mass experienced by the meteoroid.

It is a prime example of a process with \emph{positive feedback}: a decrease in mass
increases the drag force per unit mass, which results in more energy being lost to collisions
per unit of mass, which in turn accelerates the mass loss.
All but most massive and toughest meteoroids are destroyed in the process.

\section{Fragmentation} \label{af}
    Another important occurrence is the fragmentation of meteoroids.

\section*{Abstract}
    The physics of meteoroid flight in the atmosphere is 
    the complexity quickly increases when there is need to track meteoroids
    with high precision, which is often a prerequisite of a successful
    meteorite recovery.

    We examined several dynamical models of atmospheric entry of meteoroids
    and investigated the implications for determination of strewn field positions,
